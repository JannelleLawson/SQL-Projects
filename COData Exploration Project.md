Tools Used: SQL Server, Microsoft SQL Management Studio

This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover insights on global trends, infection rates, and vaccination progress. 
It was inspired by the Alex the Analyst portfolio tutorial and my troubleshooting experience.

Using a COVID-19 dataset, I:

 Cleaned and formatted data for better analysis

 Calculated important metrics like:

    - Death percentage by country

    - Infection rates compared to population

    - Rolling vaccination totals

 Explored trends across time and countries

 Practiced using CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, joins, and views

Key Skills Demonstrated

    Writing complex SQL queries

    Data cleaning and type conversion

    Using CTEs for better readability

    Joining datasets for deeper insights

    Presenting analysis-ready data for visualization (in Tableau)

Notes

This project helped me build confidence in handling real-world datasets and practicing SQL in a business context. I'm actively building on this foundation with projects in marketing analytics and music data.
